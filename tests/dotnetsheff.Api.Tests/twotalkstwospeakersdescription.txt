I should be able to reason where the change needs to be made and reason about the impact it will have.</p> <p>I want to explore what reasonable means to me, from the processes of the team all the way down to an individual block of code. Along the way, we will encounter existing frameworks, tools, and patterns that our community has developed over the years to help us to reason about our code and processes; I feel that they have often been misused and end up creating the opposite effect, adding unnecessary complexity to how we work.</p> <p>*Ian Johnson*<br/>Ian is a software developer working at Redgate, a company that develops tools for developers and database administrators.</p> <p>Ian is passionate about writing maintainable code that delivers on the needs of users. Though he considers himself an introvert, Ian loves talking with other developers, learning from their experiences and sharing his own.</p> <p>Outside of work, Ian is a passionate Star Wars fan and has been known to make the occasional really bad pun, but all of his code is \"no-pun sourced\" (sorry, couldn't resist).</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.ninjaferret.co.uk\" class=\"linkified\">http://blog.ninjaferret.co.uk</a></p> <p>@ijohnson_tnf</p> <p>*A more flexible way to store your data with MongoDB*</p> <p>If you've been anywhere near software development, the norm is to store your data in a relational form, but what if there was a different way</p> <p>We will take a look at the history of MongoDB and why it continues to be a trending database year on year. We will then go into the advantages of having a flexible document model and how we can utilize MongoDB for our application storage.</p> <p>*Kevin Smith*<br/>He runs dotnet York and dotnetsheff, and casually speaks at user groups. He is always keen to contribute to open source projects, one of the main ones being MassTransit. He has worked across a broad range of domains including: law, travel, finance and analytics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://kevsoft.net\" class=\"linkified\">https://kevsoft.net</a></p> <p>@kev_bite</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This event will be split into two parts, Gary Ewan Park presenting Adding a layer of Chocolate(y) and the second half will be Toby Henderson presenting HTTP API patterns.</p> <p>**Adding a layer of Chocolate(y)**</p> <p>Following Build 2018 where Microsoft announced that they will be collaborating with Boxstarter and Chocolatey to ensure the best Windows setup experience, there has never been a better time to look at these two technologies.</p> <p>In this session, we will learn from experienced package author, Chocolatey.org moderator and Chocolatey Employee, Gary, on how to automate the installation and configuration of all the software you need to get your job done. This will include the use of open source software tools Chocolatey and Boxstarter.</p> <p>Find out how to wrap each of your tools and applications in a well-specified Chocolatey package. Learn about common pitfalls and get an inside perspective on the package moderation process so that you can publish to the public repository on Chocolatey.org with confidence.</p> <p>Learn how to orchestrate the installation of all your packages (including reboots) with Boxstarter. Build up a fully configured developer machine from scratch, or redeploy your test environment with ease and reliability.</p> <p>However, Chocolatey is not only about the packaging of existing, 3rd Party Applications. You can also apply the exact same techniques to allow your customers to download, install and upgrade your software with ease.</p> <p>This talk is rated[masked] with a target audience of all Windows-based developers and professionals who want to spend more time getting things are done and less time reinstalling the software.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Gary Ewan Park has over 10 years experience working as a developer on technologies such as ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, SharePoint, Silverlight, and many others. Throughout his career, Gary has always looked to see how things can be automated, using the mantra that if you do the same thing more than twice, it is time for automation. In 2017 he was awarded a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies. His day job has him working for Chocolatey Software, Inc.</p> <p>In his spare time, Gary contributes to a number of Open Source projects including Chocolatey, Boxstarter, Cake, Cake-Contrib, GitVersion, and GitReleaseManager.</p> <p>Gary is a founding member of the Aberdeen Developers, a .NET User Group, that holds monthly sessions on any topic related to the Microsoft<br/>.NET Technology Stack.</p> <p>Gary Ewan Park (@gep13 (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gep13\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/gep13</a>))</p> <p>**HTTP API patterns**</p> <p>I GET how to DELETE but the real question is \"To PUT or to POST?\" or is it PATCH? What there's more?!</p> <p>After doing the standard HTTP CRUD, sometimes you need to do more, become a little more sophisticated in your manipulation of resources and add some depth to your HTTP API.</p> <p>This talk will take you through some common HTTP API patterns, provide you with names for these patterns so we can talk about them, describe what the patterns are and when they are generally used, and go through working examples.</p> <p>Hopefully, this information will help people create richer HTTP APIs, make you REST easy and everything 200 OK.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Toby Henderson is an Application Architect at Huddle, the #1 SharePoint alternative for enterprise content collaboration. He has over 20 years experience of commercial software engineering and has given talks at DDD events.</p> ",
